laser-cooler-mon
----------------

A device to monitor the water cooling loop as it flows to the laser
tube and as it returns to the reservoir.

This runs on a ESP8266-03 module. It communicates with two DS18B20
digital temperature sensors, and sends the data to our MQTT broker.

Programming this device is done using the 6-pin FTDI header on the
device.
